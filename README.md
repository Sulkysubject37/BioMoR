Perfect! Based on your DESCRIPTION file for BioMoR, here’s a detailed, professional README.md that reflects all the package functionality, dependencies, and purpose. This is more comprehensive than a standard README and can serve as the main GitHub and CRAN reference.

# BioMoR

**BioMoR** (Bioinformatics Modeling with Recursion and Autoencoder-Based Ensemble) is an R package for advanced bioinformatics predictive modeling. It provides tools for constructing recursive transformer-inspired architectures, autoencoders, random forests, XGBoost models, and stacked ensembles. BioMoR includes utilities for cross-validation, calibration, benchmarking, and threshold optimization in predictive modeling workflows.

Example Usage

library(BioMoR)
library(dplyr)

# Example dataset
data <- matrix(rnorm(500), nrow = 50, ncol = 10)

# Train an autoencoder-based ensemble
model <- BioMoR::train_autoencoder_ensemble(data)

# Evaluate predictions
preds <- BioMoR::predict_ensemble(model, newdata = data)

# Benchmark performance
results <- BioMoR::benchmark_model(preds, true_labels = sample(0:1, 50, replace = TRUE))
